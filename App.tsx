// FIX: The original content of this file was invalid placeholder text, which
// caused compilation errors. The project's entry point (`index.tsx`) correctly
// uses the component from `src/App.tsx`. This file has been updated to
// re-export the component from `src/App.tsx` to resolve the errors without
// altering the established project structure.
export { default } from './src/App';
